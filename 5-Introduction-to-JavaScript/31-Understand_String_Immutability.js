// Immutable = cannot be altered once created. A string is immutable, which
// means you can't change individual characters in the string, but the variable
// holding the string *can* be reassigned to a different string.

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World";
